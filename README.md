Community-made Vainglory clone in UE5.

## Status
Creation of Todo lists, organization, scope, and deadlines.

## Contribute
I will accept all contributions.
There are only a few things to look out for. Your contribution should...
- not break the game.
- be balanced.
- benefit the majority of players.
- ensure that all used assets/media are owned/created by you or if free include the license.
- not contain anything (like heroes, maps etc.) that exist 1-to-1 in the original game.
If you want to work on a specific feature listed below, create an issue telling you are working on it.
Try your best to make the deadline.
